# Capstone Documentation

Hey all. While this may just be a simple repo for uploading documentation, I still think that it would be best to follow standard source control procedures and create a branch whenever you want to edit something. That way, we don't really need to worry about stepping on toes (rare, but could happen). 

Feel free to create any directories as needed using the structure laid out

- Problem Statement 
  - Individual
